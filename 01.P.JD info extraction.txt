a) Process: JD info extraction

1. Given a JD, extract all JD info (categorize it properly: roles, responsibilities, experience, skills, etc.) needed in order to properly assess any CV that is later provided to reply to that JD request. Enhance keyword extraction and categorization granularity by including a "keywords" object with sub-arrays for technical terms, action verbs, and soft skills, capturing synonyms, must-haves, and nice-to-haves. Introduce new categories such as "soft_skills" and "cultural_fit" to handle interpersonal and company alignment aspects. Incorporate contextual analysis by adding a "context_summary" field interpreting the JD's overall intent. For multiple JD comparison, add a "benchmark_keywords" array based on cross-referencing similar JDs via web searches or browsing relevant sites to identify industry-standard terms. Expand to include fit for broader assessment by extracting "growth_potential_indicators" implicitly via cultural_fit and soft_skills, aligning with company values.

2. Regarding the extracted JD info, please carefully create a rating and weights that should be used for some categories (that make sense - like: experience, skills), in order to use it later in other rating process. Note: The sum of the total ratings should make: 1000 and the sum of weights: 1. Implement a dynamic and justified weighting system by adjusting weights based on JD emphasis, role seniority, and benchmarks (e.g., higher for hard skills in technical roles), with justifications provided for each category. Introduce sub-weights or sub-aspects within categories where applicable.

3.The JD information extracted should be in a format that can be easily provided to any LLM, so that it recognizes it, as it is, what it is, and the goal/function of it. Integrate automation tools or prompts for consistency by noting the extraction method (e.g., manual or tool-assisted) and updating usage guidance with sample LLM prompts. Improve validation and error handling by adding a "confidence_scores" object for each category on a 0-1 scale, handling ambiguities through conditional sub-requirements.

4.Allow the download of that information so that it can be stored in a repository somewhere. Add metadata like version and timestamp in the output for versioning in repositories.
