Job Personal Scoring System.The purpose of all this prompts and steps is to improve your chances to get the job you want/need!



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applying for Jobs with a Personal Scoring System. You also get personalized action plans for skill improvements, to close remaining gaps.

Note: Initially this was created with Grok LLM, but also works with others. If you have the time, I would advise you to perform this also with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude (and others ...), and compare the results.  Use your common sense, and generate a action plan that you really feel is the right thing to do.

Hope this helps you improving your chances to get the job you want/need!  Enjoy! 

Note: You still will have to sweet doing those action plans! Work it out!
