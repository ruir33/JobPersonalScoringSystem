c) Report elaboration - In clear text (only ASCII characters), using previous assessment output (which I will attach).

1) Elaborate a paragraph describing the strengths; enhance structure and visualization by incorporating tables or structured lists (e.g., Markdown tables in ASCII) for strengths, adding quantifiable metrics (e.g., "covers 80% of JD requirements") and visual indicators like asterisks for priority levels. Expand to holistic insights by adding elements on overall fit (e.g., cultural alignment) and predictive elements (e.g., retention potential).

2) Elaborate a paragraph describing the Weakness; similarly, use tables or structured lists for weaknesses, with quantifiable metrics and visual indicators.

3) Elaborate a paragraph about actions required to improve the weakness (please categorize the actions temporarily, like: - Immediate term (less 24h required); - Really short term (1 day to 1 week); - short term (1 week to 1 month); Medium (1 month to 3 months); Medium long (3 months to 6 months); Long ( more than  6 months). Make actions more personalized, measurable, and integrated by including personalized recommendations tied to specific CV gaps with measurable KPIs (e.g., "Achieve 80% proficiency via certification"), categorizing further by cost/effort (e.g., free vs. paid), and integrating predictive analytics (e.g., "Could boost score by 150 points"). Use web_search or browse_page tools to suggest current resources (e.g., latest courses), and tie to benchmarks from talent acquisition strategies.

4) Provide the rating achieved with current CV (I am expecting something like:  "Rate:  X  of 1000  points". Make it dynamic and data-driven by including comparisons (e.g., "above industry average of 600" via benchmarks from web_search).

5) Generate a report in json with all info from previous points, so that can it be easily provided to any LLM, so that it recognizes it, as it is, what it is, and the goal/function of it. Incorporate transparency, bias checks, and compliance by adding a "transparency_statement" field disclosing AI usage and a "bias_audit" object (e.g., flagging issues and mitigations), ensuring compliance notes (e.g., GDPR). In the JSON, add "action_kpis" array for tracking, "visualizations" (e.g., simple ASCII charts), "campaign_analysis" (e.g., recruiting insights), and make it dynamic with conditional fields (e.g., if score <500, add "rejection_reasons"). Integrate automation tools for consistency by using code_execution (e.g., to format text or calculate projected scores) or web_search for benchmarks, adding an "automation_method" field. Expand to holistic insights and feedback loops by including a "holistic_insights" section with tiers (e.g., "Proceed to interview") and a "feedback_loop" for candidate responses. Update "usage_guidance" with prompts for LLM extensions (e.g., "Generate email feedback from this JSON").

6. Allow the download of that information so that it can be stored in a repository somewhere. Add metadata like "report_version" and "timestamp" in JSON for repository versioning.
