b) CV evaluation process

1. Given a CV (in attach), please assess it against the JD extracted info, and rate it using the previous defined ratings and weights. Enhance matching granularity and semantic analysis by introducing semantic similarity checks (e.g., using vector embeddings via code_execution tool with libraries like numpy or torch for cosine similarity on keywords) to compare CV content against JD elements beyond exact keywords, accounting for synonyms. Add an "evidence_quotes" array in each category's JSON entry, pulling direct excerpts from the CV to justify scores. Differentiate scoring for quantitative aspects (e.g., years of experience) vs. qualitative (e.g., project depth), with sub-scores for must-haves vs. nice-to-haves. Incorporate external benchmarks and verification by cross-referencing CV claims with external sources using web_search or browse_page tools to verify certifications or benchmark experience levels, adding a "verification_status" field in the JSON for each category and a "benchmark_comparison" section comparing the candidate's profile to industry averages. Expand to holistic fit and predictive analytics by assessing broader fit with new categories like "cultural_alignment_score" (matching CV soft skills to JD cultural_fit) and "growth_potential" (e.g., based on learning eagerness via certifications), using web_search for predictive elements like retention rates.

2. The assessment output should also be generated in json, so that it can be easily provided to any LLM, so that it recognizes it, as it is, what it is, and the goal/function of it. Implement a dynamic and adaptive scoring system by allowing adjustments based on CV specifics or JD updates (e.g., boost weights for underrepresented skills), including "adjustment_justification" in the JSON if modified. Use code_execution to automate score calculations (e.g., Python scripts for weighted sums) and introduce probabilistic scoring (e.g., confidence intervals for assigned_scores). Integrate automation tools for consistency and bias reduction by using code_execution for parsing CV text (e.g., regex to extract skills) or x_keyword_search/x_semantic_search for social validation if profiles are linked, adding an "assessment_method" field noting tool usage and a "bias_check" flag. Improve validation, error handling, and feedback loops by adding "confidence_scores" (0-1 scale) per category, flagging "data_gaps" for incomplete CVs, and including a "feedback_loop" section with actionable insights. Add a "holistic_recommendation" field with interview suitability tiers and metadata like "assessment_version" for tracking.

3. Allow the download of that information so that it can be stored in a repository somewhere.
